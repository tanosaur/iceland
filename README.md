# Iceland: Textures & Landscapes

_Iceland: Textures & Landscapes_ is a website featuring photographic work from Iceland. It is a study of listening, stillness, and reflection. This project aims for harmony of content, aesthetic, and build. In other words, for the website and its code to be as beautiful and minimal.
